# Introduction  
This is the 2nd project of the course "Software Development for Algorithmic
Problems". The first part of the project involved implementing an Autoencoder Neural Network 
and performing a variety of training experiments, in order to achieve the best
possible values of validation loss and validation accuracy. In the second part
of the project, we reuse the encoder layers of the autoencoder, and add 2 extra layers:
a fully-connected layer and an output layer. The newly constructed model is
a Convolutional Neural Network, which is then trained in 2 phases. After
training, we evaluate our model on a validation set and interestingly, it performs very well 
in our classification task.  

The dataset used for both parts of the project was once again [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), but this time the labels were also used, 
in order to measure the accuracy scores of our models.
